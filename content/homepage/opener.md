Wild Fenn (previously known as Engel and the Mountain People) are an Indie/Folk band based in Devon, UK. Rising and falling harmonies combined with poetic lyrics paint pictures of summer nights and bygone days. Our songs are heavily inspired by the natural world and our lyrics aim to convey a subtle urgency to remember, cherish and protect our wild places
